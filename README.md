Future plan if I continue this project:

0% Flip the image when duplicated
0% Add Eiphany icon
80% Finish combatant card database (cards name left)
100% Backup png, change all image to webp to improve speed
0% Impliment ladder count
0% Add redo button
0% Add cookie to remember preset team and so you don't have to manual select combatant everytime
0% Live calcuation on hover button shat show how much points will be added
0% Add current points of each card
0% Add neutral card database
0% Scale down and fix layout size. Make 3 layout viewable in 1280x720p
0% Mobile friendly/super condense layout

**Expansion**
Div screen into half, so you can view possible acquireable item/card, and event choice in the current chaos world.
At items target and how to get them
Deck builder: update database including epiphany variation and divine epiphany, add target card at the same line with target item
